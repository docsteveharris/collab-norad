## Patients

- [ ] TODO(2016-03-17): concept of sequentially stricter subgroups

We requested data on one hundred consecutive admissions with septic shock from eight critical care units across Europe. Patients were eligible if they were treated for presumed infection, required noradrenaline infusion for at least one hour, and survived for a minimum of 24 hours (in order that we could characterise their first 24 hours of treatment). We defined a subgroup of patients with resistant septic shock where the noradrenaline infusion was not weaned within 24 hours, and a nested subgroup with tachycardic septic shock subgroup. This latter subgroup mimicked the control group in the study by Morelli et al where the heart rate had to be greater than 95 beats/minute at 24 hours, and the patients had not received beta-blockers therapy.

## Definitions

We abstracted patient and treatment level variables at 1 and 24 hours after the onset of septic shock. We summarised additional vasopressors on an ordinal scale, and similarly generated a scale to quantify sedation (see supplementary file). We classifed mean arterial pressure at 24 hours as high when greater than or equal to 75mmHg (as per Asfar et al), and heart rates as high when greater than or equal to 95.[@Asfar:2014dl] We used ICU mortality as the primary outcome.

## Research questions

We sought the proportion of ICU patients presenting with septic shock in whom shock persisted at 24 hours, and the subgroup who were also tachycardic (heart rate greater than 95/minute). Persistent shock at 24 hours depends, in this population, on an ongoing requirement for noradrenaline. This in turn depends on the target blood pressure, the sedation used, concurrent inotrope and vasopressor support, steroid use, the approach to fluid management, and additional organ support. We therefore built models of the noradrenaline dose at 24 hours including these treatment variables as well as patient characteristics at baseline (age, sex, weight, source of sepsis, initial SOFA score, and initial lactate). Finally, we evaluated the relationship between noradrenaline dose at 24 hours and ICU mortality, and specifically sought to define whether the relationship was similar for subgroups with high and low heart rates, and high and low mean arterial pressures.

## Statistical analaysis	

All models included random effects for the ICU. We used a linear model with a log transform for the noradrenaline dose, and a logistic link for ICU mortality. We were interested in the relative importance of each predictor rather than its absolute effect (since that will depend on the units of measurement). We therefore standardised each variable by subtracting its mean and dividing by twice the standard deviation.[Gelman]

We used the intraclass correlation (ICC) to summarise the proportion of the variation in each outcome that might be explained by the admitting ICU rather than individual patient differences. A high value implies that patients admitted to the same ICU are likely to have similar outcomes. For linear outcomes, the ICC is calculated as $$\frac{V_{ICU}}{V_{ICU}+V_{patient}}$$, and for binary outcomes as $$\frac{V_{ICU}}{V_{ICU}+\frac{\pi^2/}{3}$$.[@Merlo:2006hs]
<!-- - [ ] TODO(2016-03-17): bootstrap CI for ICC? -->

For the final ICU mortality model, where we specifically investigated the effect of noradrenaline dose on mortality, we allowed its effect to vary between ICUs in a random intercept/random slope model, and included interactions between noradrenaline and high and low mean arterial pressures, high and low heart rates.


# Results
```{r strobe, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

(los.itu.0    <- ff.np(data=wdt.original, exclude.los.itu.0))
with(wdt.original, table(exclude.los.itu.0, is.na(ne.1)))
with(wdt.original, table(exclude.los.itu.0, mort.itu))
(include    <- ff.np(data=wdt.original, include))
(grp.ne24    <- ff.np(data=wdt, grp.ne24))
(rx.betablock <- ff.np(data=wdt.original, exclude.rx.betablock))
(grp.morelli    <- ff.np(data=wdt, grp.morelli))
(hosp.n       <- ff.mediqr(N, data=wdt[,.N,by=hosp]))
```

We screened `r nrow(wdt.original)` consecutive admissions with septic shock from `r length(unique(wdt$hosp))` hospitals in 4 European countries. We excluded 45 patients (6 missing data on their initial noradrenaline requirement, and 39 deaths within 24 hours). Each hospital contributing a median of `r hosp.n$q50` patients (IQR `r hosp.n$iqr`).

The subgroup of patients with resistant septic shock comprised `r grp.ne24$n[2]` patients (`r grp.ne24$n[2]`) who had not been weaned from noradrenaline within 24 hours. Within this, the tachycardic-shocked subgroup included `r grp.morelli$n[2]` (`r grp.morelli$p[2]`) patients with a heart rate greater than 95 beats/minute without preceding beta-blocker treatment. Subgroups were not evenly distributed between ICUs (Figure 1).

## Patient characteristics

```{r patients, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# source(file="../analysis/table1_all.R")

(sofa1 <- ff.mediqr(sofa.1,dp=1))
(lac24 <- ff.mediqr(lac.24,dp=1))
(lac24gt2 <- ff.np(var=lac24gt2, data=wdt[,.(lac24gt2=ifelse(lac.24>2 & !is.na(lac.24),1,0))], dp=0)) 
```
<!-- see Table 1 -->

Septic shock occurred within 48 hours of admission for 460 (80%) of patient. Pneumonia was the commonest cause (292 patients, 42%). Patient variables at 24 hours following onset of septic shock are reported in Table 1. The median SOFA score was 10 (IQR 7 to 12), and the lactate at the same time was `r lac24$q50` mmol/l (IQR `r lac24$iqr`) with `r lac24gt2$n[2]` (`r lac24gt2$p[2]`) patients have a lactate greater than 2 mmol/l. The majority of patients (556, 77%) were mechanically ventilated, and 178 (25%) had already started renal replacement therapy (RRT). The overall ICU mortality was 35% (242 deaths). For the subgroups with resistant shock, and tachycardic-shock the ICU mortalities were 40% (227 deaths), and 49% (131 deaths respectively).

```

We examined noradrenaline doses administered at 24 hours after ranking the ICUs by their mean 24 hour mortality (Figure 2, top panel). Noradrenaline doses were higher in units that had higher mean mortalites (test for trend by comparing the coefficient in a linear model to zero, p<0.0001). We repeated the process for the treatment variables that might affect 24 hour noradrenaline dose (mean arterial blood pressure, fluid balance, other vasoactive drugs, steroids, sedation, and other organ support). This showed that mean arterial pressure (p=0.015) was higher (p=0.014), and fluid balances lower in units with higher mean mortality. Similarly, other vasoactive drugs (p<0.001), corticosteroids (p=0.01) and sedation (p<0.001) were used more often, as was mechanical ventilation (p=0.0001), but not renal replacement therapy (p=0.056) (see supplementary Figure 1).

## Predictors of 24 hour treatment variables

For noradrenaline, mean arterial pressure and fluid balance, we entered each variable into a model to understand the relative contributions of patient predictors (at baseline) and the ICU level effect on these measures at 24 hours (Figure 2 [lower panel], and Table 2). For example, higher baseline SOFA scores and lactate measures are were associated with noradrenaline requirement at 24 hours. However, the same variables had little effect on MAP at the same time point (presumably because it was defined by noradrenaline dose instead), and baseline lactate but not the SOFA score was correlated with fluid balance.

The ICC (proportion of variance in the multilevel model accounted for by the ICU) for the 24 hour values of noradrenaline dose was 44%, for MAP was 4%, and for fluid balance was 29%.

Figure 2 (Bottom panel): Standardised regression coefficients for patient level predictors of 24 hour treatment variables (noradrenaline dose, mean arterial pressure, and fluid balance). The point estimates are surrouneded by black and grey limits representing one and two standard error limits. For MAP, the standard errors were so large that the x-axis scale has been extended to four standardised coefficients above and below zero.
