# Background of the study:

(Roughly summarized!) 

Patients in septic shock have high level of endogenous catecholamines , on the top of that we add esogenous catecholamines. That’s why they are subject to an adrenergic stress that can be negative for them.

When the patient is stabilized (our 24 hr time point), tachycardia can be a marker of this stress, and studies are evaluating if b-blocker (BB) can be useful to reduce it (pleiotropic cardiac +non cardiac effects).
Morelli’s trial showed better outcome in term of mortality for septic shock (SS) patients treated with BB, but the control group has a very high mortality that has been criticised.

So…. This study has been started to:
-evaluate what is the mortality in septic shock patients throughout Europe
- evaluate if differences in outcome among ITU can be related to different managements in term of sedation, fluid filling, inotrops ( global severity seems to be similar in the 8 centers, they are all general ITU with surgical+medical+/- trauma pts)
- evaluate if different HR ( ≥95 or less) in patients that receive same amount of NE is related with different outcome( so if tachycardic patients die more than pts with normal HR at same level of NE)

Three times:
-   1hr of NE (T0)
-   Peak of NE in 24hrs (T1)
-   24hrs after starting NE ( with the assumption that after 24 hrs from the diagnosis of SS the patient can be considered stabilised-hemodynamically stable) (T2)

Pts divided in three groups  for the NE rate:
1.  ≤0.1 mcg/kg/min
2.  0.11-0.3 mcg/kg/min
3.  >03 mcg/kg/min

Our blank table ( or attempt to ☺ ):
1.  1st hypothesis : non-survivor (NSurv) patients receive higher level of NE than survivors (Surv)
→  NE at T0  vs   mortality  ( or the three times?)
But it could be due just to the higher severity of NSurv group. So:
2.  2nd Hpx: No difference in severity  between Surv/NSurv
→ SOFA score at To in surv vs Nsurv     
 SOFA score is low accuracy score so we can compare other signs of organ dysfunction: lactate, RRT, MV with PaO2/FiO2
3.  3rd Hpx:  the different rate of NE between  Surv/NSurv is not related to the  different management in the two group
→ SDI, VADI, FB Surv vs NSurv

Where:
SDI = sedation index
VADI= vasoactive drugs index
FB = fluid balance ( day 1 and cumulative FB for 4 days)
4.  If  no difference in management and severity between Surv and NSurv
→ NE rate has an association with mortality
4th Hpx: HR as marker of cathecolaminergic stress?
              Divide the patients in three group for NE ( as above) and in each group compare mortality of pts with HR ≥95 with pts with normal HR



Comparison in management and outcome of SS among the 6 ( for now!) centres:
1.  Mortality:
We have ITU mortality and Hospital mortality. We used a 28days ITU mortality for the first analysis
2.  Characteristic  of the population:
Demographic data, admission SOFA, source of sepsis , multiresistent bugs, immunosuppression, etc, etc
3.  Severity score of the 6 centres. If the severity of pts is the same ( as we found that before)
The difference in mortality could be related to different management:
-   NE levels
-   SDI
-   VADI
-   FB
-   MAP target
-   MV
-   Steroids
-   lactate
